# crashLog
The purpose of this site is to take openly available data regarding car-bike accidents in NYC and make it more explorable. There is a map section and the user is able to enter in parameters such as date and time ranges. The hope is that users will be able to identify particularly dangerous routes/times to travel via bike, and possibly avoid them.
